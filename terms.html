            <p>
                These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of the Flaudio
                mobile application and related services (&quot;Flaudio&quot;, &quot;the
                App&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;). By
                downloading, accessing, or using Flaudio, you agree to be bound by these
                Terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Relationship with Our Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Your use of Flaudio also relies on how we handle your personal data. Our
                <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains what information we
                collect, how we use it, and your rights and choices, including those
                available under laws such as the EU/EEA/UK General Data Protection
                Regulation (&quot;GDPR&quot;) and other applicable data protection laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. If there is any conflict between
                these Terms and the Privacy Policy regarding personal data, the Privacy
                Policy will generally control for data protection matters.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
                You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your
                country) to use Flaudio. By using the App, you confirm that you meet this
                requirement and that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Accounts and Access</h3>
            <p>
                Some features of Flaudio require an account. You are responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
                <li>All activity that occurs under your account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You agree to notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized access to your
                account.
            </p>

            <p>
                We may suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably believe that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have violated these Terms or applicable law.</li>
                <li>Your use poses a risk to the App, other users, or our service providers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Subscriptions, Payments, and Billing</h3>
            <p>
                Flaudio offers optional paid subscriptions that unlock additional features.
                Paid subscriptions are processed through the Apple App Store and/or Google
                Play Store (together &quot;App Stores&quot;). We do not directly process or
                store your payment information.
            </p>

            <h4>4.1 Subscription Information</h4>
            <p>
                Before you complete a purchase, the App Store will display the applicable
                subscription price, billing period (for example, monthly or yearly), and
                any trial or introductory offers, if available.
            </p>

            <h4>4.2 Auto-Renewal</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period
                    unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current
                    period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the
                    end of the current period at the price shown when you subscribed,
                    unless that price has changed and you have been notified by the App
                    Store.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4.3 Managing and Cancelling Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>
                You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your App
                Store account settings. Because billing and cancellation are handled by the
                App Stores, we cannot cancel subscriptions or issue refunds directly, except
                where required by applicable law.
            </p>

            <h4>4.4 Trials and Promotions</h4>
            <p>
                If offered, free trials or promotional periods will be clearly described
                before you subscribe. At the end of a trial, your subscription will renew
                automatically at the standard rate unless you cancel before the trial ends.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Features, Changes, and Availability</h3>
            <p>
                Some features of Flaudio may be available for free, while others may
                require a subscription. We may add, modify, or remove features (free or
                paid) at any time to improve the App or comply with legal or technical
                requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flaudio is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot;
                basis. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free,
                or available in all countries or languages.
            </p>

            <h3>6. User Content and Third-Party Content</h3>
            <h4>6.1 Your Content</h4>
            <p>
                You may add or import content into Flaudio, such as media files, URLs (for
                example, podcasts), transcripts, notes, and other materials
                (&quot;User Content&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>
                You retain ownership of your User Content. By adding or importing User
                Content into the App, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide,
                royalty-free license to process, store, and use that content solely as
                necessary to operate and improve the App and provide its features to you
                (for example, transcription, translation, analysis, and flashcard
                creation).
            </p>

            <h4>6.2 Third-Party Content (e.g. Podcasts and Other Media)</h4>
            <p>
                When you use Flaudio to access or process content from the internet (such
                as podcasts, videos, or other media), that content remains the property of
                the original creators or rights holders. These Terms and your use of
                Flaudio do <strong>not</strong> transfer any ownership or intellectual
                property rights in such third-party content to you or to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for ensuring that your use of any third-party content
                with Flaudio complies with applicable law and with the terms set by the
                content provider (for example, a podcast platform&rsquo;s terms of use).
                Flaudio is intended for personal, non-commercial language-learning and
                educational use.
            </p>

            <h4>6.3 Your Responsibilities</h4>
            <p>
                You agree that you will not upload, import, or otherwise use content in
                Flaudio that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Infringes or violates the intellectual property or other rights of any
                    person or entity.
                </li>
                <li>Is illegal, harmful, or otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</li>
                <li>
                    You do not have the right or permission to use in this way.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Acceptable Use</h3>
            <p>
                You agree not to misuse the App. In particular, you agree not to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Flaudio for unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent purposes.</li>
                <li>
                    Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of
                    the App except where permitted by law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Access or attempt to access the App using automated tools (such as
                    scraping or mass data extraction) in a way that burdens our
                    infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interfere with or disrupt the App, servers, or networks connected to
                    the App.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. AI-Generated Content and Educational Use</h3>
            <p>
                Flaudio uses automated systems and AI models provided by us and our
                third-party partners to generate transcriptions, translations, example
                sentences, flashcards, and other language-learning materials.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Results may be incomplete, inaccurate, or out of date.</li>
                <li>
                    Flaudio is designed for language learning and general educational use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should not rely on AI-generated outputs for professional, legal,
                    medical, or other high-stakes purposes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9. Data Protection and International Users</h3>
            <p>
                We process personal data in accordance with our
                <a href="./privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Because Flaudio may be used
                by people in different countries, your information may be processed in and
                transferred to countries other than the one in which you live. Where
                required by law, we implement appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United
                Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal bases for processing your personal data
                and your data protection rights (such as access, correction, deletion,
                objection, and data portability) are described in the Privacy Policy. You
                also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection
                authority.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Children’s Use</h3>
            <p>
                Flaudio is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not
                knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are
                under 13, you may not use the App. If you believe a child under 13 has
                provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate
                action.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>
                Flaudio, including its design, code, and branding, is protected by
                intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
                non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for your personal,
                non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Except as expressly allowed by these Terms or by applicable mandatory law,
                you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App.
            </p>

            <h3>12. Third-Party Services and App Stores</h3>
            <p>
                Flaudio may rely on third-party services (for example, cloud storage,
                analytics, payment processors, and AI providers). Your use of those
                services may be subject to separate terms and privacy policies set by those
                providers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your access to Flaudio through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store is
                also subject to the applicable App Store terms and policies. In the event
                of any conflict between these Terms and the App Store terms, the App Store
                terms may apply to the extent required by that App Store.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, Flaudio is provided &quot;as
                is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; without warranties of any kind,
                whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to
                implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                and non-infringement.
            </p>

            <h3>14. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall we be liable for
                any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or
                for any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or
                indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible
                losses, resulting from:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your use of or inability to use the App.</li>
                <li>Any unauthorized access to or use of our systems or your data.</li>
                <li>
                    Any interruption, suspension, modification, or discontinuation of the
                    App.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To the extent that our liability cannot be excluded under applicable law,
                our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the App or
                these Terms shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us for the App or
                subscription during the twelve (12) months immediately prior to the event
                giving rise to the claim, or the minimum amount required by applicable law
                if greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
                damages or implied warranties, so the above limitations may not fully apply
                to you. In those cases, the limitations will apply only to the extent
                permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction.
            </p>

            <h3>15. Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p>
                We may update these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect
                changes in the App, legal requirements, or business practices. When we make
                material changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you, such as by
                updating the &quot;Effective Date&quot; at the top of this page or by
                providing an in-app notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your continued use of Flaudio after changes to these Terms become effective
                means you accept the updated Terms.
            </p>

            <h3>16. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of Canada, without regard to its
                conflict-of-law principles, unless the laws of your country of residence
                require otherwise. If you are a consumer in the EU, UK, or another
                jurisdiction that provides mandatory consumer protections, those protections
                will still apply.
            </p>
